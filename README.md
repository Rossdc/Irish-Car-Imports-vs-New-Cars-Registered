# Irish-Car-Imports-vs-New-Cars-Registered

An interactive visualisation of Irish Car Imports vs New Cars Registered from 2005-2019 can be located at https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ross.currid/viz/ImportsvsNonImports-Ireland2005-2019/Dashboard1

As can be seen, the ratio of non imports to imports was significantly less from 2005 - 2008 followed by a sharp increase in 2009, which is perhaps due to the recession that hit Ireland at this time which may have changed purchasing behaviours. While the ratio increased in following years, the ratio has subsequently declined, and is near equilibrium as of 2019 despite the boom in the Irish economy. Total new cars imported or registered was at it's lowest in 2009, and highest in 2007.
